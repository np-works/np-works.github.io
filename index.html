              <p id = "dis_kpop_par"> In high school, I came across a Youtube video called "Teens React to EXO - Call me baby".  Watching a kpop mv online for the first time was a very unique experience. I had never seen a genre of music that had dancing as a major component of a song and so watching these handsome guys dancing so in sync with each other was a pretty cool thing to discover. On top of that the music seemed very different than what I was used to with American music. As you can imagine, I started watching and searching for their other songs and fell into a deep hole of obsession. But it wasnt only their songs that were so attention grabbing, I later found that they had really fun and diverse personalities while watching their live TV specials. Pretty soon I became a true fan, waiting for their upcoming new song MVs every few months called "comebacks" and squeeling like a schoolgirl whenever my favorite member came on screen. Don't laugh, I was only 15. Mind you, I had never really cared about any American boy bands or ever was a Belieber so me getting all excited about a Korean boy band was out of my character. I've been a fan of EXO ever since. </p>
